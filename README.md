# Java 141 Final Assignment

## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description

The Final Project in my first Java Class. We did not use git or any versioning software, thus there were no commits during the completion of the project. The instructions were as follows:


- Create a program that sorts an array of random numbers. 
- The # of random numbers will be chosen by the user. 
- The user will also choose a min and a max, and the random numbers that are generated will all be equal to or between these values. 
- The user will be asked if they want to print the unsorted and sorted lists of random numbers.
