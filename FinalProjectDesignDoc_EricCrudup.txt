Description: Create a program that sorts an array of random numbers. The # of random numbers
will be chosen by the user. The user will also choose a min and a max, and the random numbers
that are generated will all be equal to or between these values. The user will be asked if 
they want to print the unsorted and sorted lists of random numbers.

TOP-LEVEL-DESIGN

Main:

1) Ask the user for input						(F)
2) Generate, possibly print, and sort random numbers based on input	(F)

Step 1 of Main:
NAME: input
DESCR: takes input from user as parameters(not the programming kind) for 
creating the list of random numbers. 
PARAMS: Scanner scan, int[] parameters, String[] printer
RETURN: void
1)ask user for a min							
2)ask user for a max
3)ask user for the # of randoms
4)ask user if they would like to see the unsorted list
5)ask user if they would like to see the final sorted list

Step 2 of Main:
NAME: sort
DESCR: creates a list of random numbers based on the users input, asks if the user wants to 
print the unsorted list, then sorts the list.
PARAMS: int[] parameters, String[] printer
RETURN: void
1)create an array of random numbers based on user input values		(F)
2)sort the array from lowest number to highest				(F)

Step 1 of sort
NAME: list_generator
DESCR: create an array of random numbers based on user input values
PARAMS: int howmany, int max, int min, int i, int[] list, int[] printer
1)fill an array (list[]) with random numbers between a max and min

Step 2 of sort
NAME: list_sorter
DESCR: sort the array from lowest to highest
PARAMS: int howmany, int max, int min, int i, int j, int[] list, String[] printer
RETURN: void
1)Have a 2nd array (int[] count) count the instances of each separate 
value between the max and min in the first array
2)take each value between max and min from the 2nd array and apply it to
the first array the number of times it was counted
